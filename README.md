# Sleep-Classification-Model
This repository contains a sleep classification model based python code built based on image classification and it will predict whether a person is sleeping or not based on Tensorflow/Keras and Neural Networks Model. Here we have trained the model based on sleeping and not sleeping images so that this model can work on new unseen images
